00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.000
A couple of weeks ago, I was perusing the

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.639
Reverb dot com app and I was specifically looking at the section called just listed.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.550
If you're not familiar with this part of Reverb,

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.840
it is a place where the new listings are things that have just been placed up for sale.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.719
And I find that it's a good place to find deals.

6
00:00:17.729 --> 00:00:21.149
You can find something for a really good price that maybe someone just

7
00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:25.239
put up moments ago and you can snag it before somebody else does.

8
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.447
Now, something here called My Eye. It was a Gold Klon

9
00:00:28.617 --> 00:00:28.947
Centaur

10
00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:32.256
just listed for $1100.

11
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.216
Now, if you know anything about Klons,

12
00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:38.337
this is an incredible deal typically right now, those are going for,

13
00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:40.817
I believe around 6 to $7000 and

14
00:00:40.926 --> 00:00:44.977
even upwards, I think of eight and $9000 that you can see them listed for sale.

15
00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:51.387
So this was a ridiculous deal and I thought man, I might need to jump on this.

16
00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:54.337
I took a quick look at the pictures, everything looked

17
00:00:54.743 --> 00:00:58.993
and I even noticed that it was a low serial number number 33.

18
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:01.034
All the pictures were decent quality.

19
00:01:01.043 --> 00:01:04.843
The seller had five stars and I thought, well, it's through reverb.

20
00:01:04.852 --> 00:01:09.603
I'm gonna pay through paypal. So I'm kind of doubly protected there. Why not?

21
00:01:09.613 --> 00:01:13.513
Let's see where this goes after I purchased it and paid for it.

22
00:01:13.524 --> 00:01:15.194
I sent the seller a message.

23
00:01:15.204 --> 00:01:16.393
I said this, hey,

24
00:01:16.403 --> 00:01:19.954
I just wanted to establish contact early since you don't have much feedback.

25
00:01:19.963 --> 00:01:24.390
Any additional history or info on this. Any idea when you will be able to ship?

26
00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:27.350
Thanks. I knew that this could potentially be a scam.

27
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:31.070
So I wanted to go ahead and message the seller early on just in case maybe it

28
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:36.490
wasn't and they were just in a bind or didn't really know the value of this pedal.

29
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.420
I'd hoped that I would hear back from the seller immediately and they would say,

30
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.030
yeah, here's some more info.

31
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.930
I'll be shipping this out tomorrow.

32
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:46.841
But of course, I didn't hear anything back immediately.

33
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.630
So I started researching it.

34
00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:51.680
If you remember earlier, I said that this was number 33.

35
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.580
And so I searched number 33 Gold Klon

36
00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:58.970
and I actually found that this exact pedal had been sold late

37
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.599
in the year of 2021 for almost $7000 if I remember correctly.

38
00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:09.279
And that kind of told me that whoever has this pedal in

39
00:02:09.288 --> 00:02:14.089
real life probably knows that it's worth a little more than $1100.

40
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.460
So

41
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.630
I immediately knew at that point this is probably a scam.

42
00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:18.850
A quick aside here guys,

43
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.339
I'm editing this video and I went to go grab a screen capture of

44
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.809
that old ad and I found something I didn't find the first time around.

45
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.770
And that is a current listing on a reverb from

46
00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:31.850
a very trusted seller in New Jersey for the gold coin

47
00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:33.509
number 33

48
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.330
the seller has tons of feedback and seems super legitimate.

49
00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.830
Now,

50
00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:42.029
the funny thing is that the pictures in that listing are the same exact pictures

51
00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.929
that the scammer used in his listing of the one I tried to buy.

52
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.119
That means he went on reverb pulled these pictures from one

53
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.229
listing and created a brand new listing to scam people.

54
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.789
All right, let's get back to the main video

55
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.940
at this point.

56
00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:59.220
I also knew that it was probably going to take me a little while to get a refund.

57
00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:03.550
So I started that process. I requested a refund from

58
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.339
the seller on Reverb and even tried to contact them saying, hey, if you're legit,

59
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.500
then reach out to me.

60
00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:14.354
I'd love to complete this, but it seems like you might be a scammer.

61
00:03:14.365 --> 00:03:18.074
Next, I reached out to reverb to ask what my next steps were.

62
00:03:18.085 --> 00:03:20.195
They told me to contact paypal.

63
00:03:20.205 --> 00:03:23.565
I started a dispute on the transaction and paypal let me know

64
00:03:23.695 --> 00:03:27.184
that they would contact the seller and give them 10 days to respond.

65
00:03:27.285 --> 00:03:30.354
If they didn't respond, then I would automatically get a refund.

66
00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:33.214
Now this is where things get really interesting.

67
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.589
The next morning when I woke up,

68
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.070
I had an email from paypal and it said that the

69
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.770
seller had updated the shipping info with a tracking number.

70
00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.190
Now, when I saw this email, I thought,

71
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.289
huh? Maybe I am getting a gold coin. Now. Let's see.

72
00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:52.529
So I plugged in the tracking number and I got this,

73
00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:59.119
this piece of it made no sense to me.

74
00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.899
Now, I will tell you guys, I was out of town so I wasn't at home.

75
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.250
But when it said that it was delivered,

76
00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:08.179
I knew that there was no possible way

77
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.850
the seller's location was listed as Australia and there is no possible way he could

78
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.829
have gotten a pedal from Australia to my house in less than a day,

79
00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.298
less than 24 hours.

80
00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:23.559
I think another weird thing about the tracking information is that it

81
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.524
said it had been shipped the day before I purchased it.

82
00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:28.174
How is that even possible

83
00:04:28.394 --> 00:04:31.545
now to cover myself? Because I was out of town.

84
00:04:31.554 --> 00:04:35.584
I did have a friend run by the house to see if there was anything there.

85
00:04:35.635 --> 00:04:39.285
Because in my mind, I'm thinking, well, maybe they shipped something,

86
00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:43.559
um, you know, and it got to my house that's not a package.

87
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.559
Um Just something with tracking info so that they can enter that in, you know,

88
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.000
as part of their scam.

89
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.920
Maybe they have some way of sending that locally.

90
00:04:52.049 --> 00:04:56.049
Um And it's just part of their whole deal. So I had my buddy Trigg,

91
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.579
who you might remember from a Noah Guthrie vlog. I had him run by the house.

92
00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:03.220
He lives in my neighborhood and there wasn't anything

93
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.779
there other than my regular mail and packages.

94
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.200
After having this info, I reached back out to paypal

95
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.510
again, appears that it was shipped before the order was even made.

96
00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:15.209
Um, and that it hasn't been,

97
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.950
uh, received or anything like that.

98
00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:21.279
I just wanted to see where things were at and kind of touch base with you guys on it.

99
00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:23.230
Ok?

100
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.399
I'm gonna review your account.

101
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.519
Uh place you on a brief hold and I'll let you know what I see.

102
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:29.489
Um

103
00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:32.750
So what what essentially without me even looking at it.

104
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.750
So if, if the seller has tracking information,

105
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.829
we will investigate that tracking information

106
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.760
to make sure it's legitimate.

107
00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:42.670
The next morning, I had an email from paypal.

108
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.880
They said that my dispute had been denied

109
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.839
paypal.

110
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.239
Let me know that the item had been delivered and because of this,

111
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.510
that my dispute was being denied.

112
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:54.700
Now,

113
00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:58.179
this is where I kind of started getting worried, to be honest.

114
00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:02.660
The whole tracking info thing was weird, but I knew that it wasn't legit.

115
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.089
I knew that there were ways to prove that it wasn't legit.

116
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.369
And so that didn't worry me too much, but this was worrisome for sure.

117
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.559
So I reached back out to reverb to say, hey, here's where things are at

118
00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:20.040
what do I do? Can you guys refund me? What's my next step?

119
00:06:20.049 --> 00:06:22.380
Reverb was super helpful through this and they

120
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.480
told me to reach back out to paypal because

121
00:06:24.489 --> 00:06:27.630
they obviously didn't look at the details of this

122
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.920
case and then it probably just got denied.

123
00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:30.899
Um You know,

124
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.989
just because it said it had been delivered and they just let it go through that way.

125
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.470
Now this was over the weekend and I was also traveling back home.

126
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.660
So I thought first thing Monday morning, I'll reach back out to them.

127
00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:43.399
I have your account pulled up here.

128
00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:43.570
How

129
00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:43.809
can I

130
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:44.019
help?

131
00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:44.910
Great.

132
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:52.459
Um, well, I had a dispute um, that got denied and I just need to see about getting that

133
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.250
um,

134
00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:54.269
situated.

135
00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:59.350
It seemed like the details just kind of got overlooked and it, it got denied rather,

136
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.250
rather quickly without much consideration. So I just need to follow up on that and

137
00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:06.149
Oh, sure,

138
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.260
definitely let me help you out on this.

139
00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:13.690
And I see here that there's a tracking number,

140
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.750
maybe that's the reason why it got denied.

141
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.549
Correct? Yeah, I, I was,

142
00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:18.040
I'm

143
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.279
checking.

144
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.649
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

145
00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:20.730
Go ahead. Sorry.

146
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.799
Yes, I was aware or I was told because they provided a tracking number

147
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.019
and then it says it was delivered. That's why it got denied. But,

148
00:07:30.359 --> 00:07:31.359
um, again,

149
00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:35.679
I think there's a lot of elements to this that just got ignored because of that.

150
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.040
Hm. I see. I'm so sorry about that, but don't worry.

151
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.079
Um, definitely I can,

152
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:47.459
you know, do an investigation here once I was able to invalidate the tracking number

153
00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:52.220
and it was not delivered to your ship to address, I can overturn this case for you. Ok.

154
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:57.309
So check the tracking, um, it was delivered the 23rd of June.

155
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.709
However, there's only city and state here.

156
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:05.079
Um, were you not able to receive this tracking?

157
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.299
Well, no, see that, that's, that's what I mean is that the tracking

158
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.450
the elements of the tracking number? Like, don't,

159
00:08:13.609 --> 00:08:17.649
they don't make sense like the order was from somebody in Australia.

160
00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:19.890
The item was shipped

161
00:08:20.359 --> 00:08:26.390
before I placed the order. It said it got to my city three hours

162
00:08:26.709 --> 00:08:27.869
after

163
00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:29.209
I ordered it.

164
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.510
Um

165
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:32.609
And

166
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:38.989
like it, it just, and, and the, the, the like I ordered this through reverb dot com,

167
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.179
um

168
00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:43.650
They have acknowledged that the seller is fraudulent.

169
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.340
Um I have

170
00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:46.219
um

171
00:08:46.369 --> 00:08:48.440
you know, I have correspondence with them

172
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.119
telling me that the seller is fraudulent.

173
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:57.099
No, actually, um I can definitely tell um that this tracking number is not valid.

174
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.179
Uh The transaction date was the 22nd,

175
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.909
your tracking number. It was shipped out the 21st of June.

176
00:09:04.929 --> 00:09:07.039
So definitely that doesn't check out.

177
00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:08.359
Um

178
00:09:08.479 --> 00:09:09.590
Don't worry,

179
00:09:10.169 --> 00:09:13.390
sorry if this was overlooked, but I got you on this.

180
00:09:13.789 --> 00:09:13.869
Ok.

181
00:09:14.469 --> 00:09:15.090
Thank you.

182
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.289
Also, the dispute amount here was not accurate.

183
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.830
Um It, the the transaction was $1220.40

184
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.919
but the dispute amount doesn't have the 40 cents. I'll also have this, um, corrected

185
00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:36.260
and, um, if you allow me a minute or two, I'll get back to you.

186
00:09:36.679 --> 00:09:38.659
My heart is beating so fast right now.

187
00:09:40.539 --> 00:09:43.869
The kind of thing where it's like, you know, it's a fraudulent thing.

188
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.830
You know, it's a scam but

189
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:51.809
trying to prove it to someone who, you know, doesn't want to lose money like paypal.

190
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.409
Um, it just,

191
00:09:54.099 --> 00:09:54.700
you know,

192
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.789
you never know until you see that money back in your account.

193
00:09:59.155 --> 00:10:02.674
Hi. Thank you so much for patiently waiting. So there you go.

194
00:10:02.905 --> 00:10:04.565
I have good news.

195
00:10:04.575 --> 00:10:09.294
Um I have successfully reopened the case and closed it in your favor.

196
00:10:09.304 --> 00:10:11.484
You should also receive an email about this.

197
00:10:11.655 --> 00:10:15.534
A full refund of $1220.40

198
00:10:15.835 --> 00:10:17.215
will go back to your card

199
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:22.750
and uh it might take 3 to 5 business days up to one billing cycle to reflect.

200
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:28.500
And I have also, um, updated the dispute amount so that it's gonna be the full amount.

201
00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.080
Ok. Ok, great. Thank you so so much.

202
00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:32.869
Yes,

203
00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.349
I think there are two big lessons here. One is that if it seems too good to be true,

204
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.679
it probably is.

205
00:10:39.969 --> 00:10:45.150
I knew that this was a risk. I knew that it could be a scam but I went for it anyways.

206
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.650
I knew that I was protected by paypal and Reverb and both of them were

207
00:10:49.659 --> 00:10:53.229
super helpful in getting me a refund and helping me get it figured out.

208
00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:56.880
The second lesson is, is that scammers are going to scam,

209
00:10:56.909 --> 00:10:58.929
whether you're buying things through Reverb or

210
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.960
ebay or Facebook or however there are people

211
00:11:01.969 --> 00:11:05.309
out there who are going to try to scam you in one way or another.

212
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.299
This to me was pretty impressive.

213
00:11:07.309 --> 00:11:10.369
Actually, the whole, I mean, essentially mail fraud

214
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.309
saying that they had something delivered to my house and it wasn't.

215
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.250
Um,

216
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.179
you know, that definitely threw me for a loop and went beyond what I anticipated.

217
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.919
I also say that a lot of people hate on Reverb

218
00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:25.979
and paypal and ebay for the fees that they charge.

219
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.929
But in paying those fees, you get protection.

220
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.369
So whether you're buying or selling

221
00:11:31.599 --> 00:11:35.500
those companies will protect your transactions so that

222
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.169
if somebody does try to scam you,

223
00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:39.830
you can get your money back, that's gonna do it for this video.
